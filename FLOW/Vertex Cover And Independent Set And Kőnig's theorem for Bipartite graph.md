# Vertex Cover:
<br>

**A vertex cover in a graph is a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of every edge.**

<img src="images/vertex_cover1.png">

In the given graph, consider the vertex set **V_c = {1, 2, 3, 4}**. This set qualifies as a vertex cover because every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint within **V_c**. 
<br>

<br>

Similarly, the sets **V_c = \{1, 2, 4, 5\}**, **V_c = \{2, 3, 5\}** and **V_c = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}** also serve as valid vertex covers.
<br>

<br>

But **V_c = \{1, 2, 5\}** is **not** a vertex cover, because as we can see below, there is an edge which is not covered.

<br>

<br> 
<br>
<br>

**Finding any vertex cover set is a simple task because the set of all vertices always serves as a vertex cover surely. However, the real challenge lies in finding the minimum vertex cover.**

<br>

## Minimum Vertex Cover:
<br>

**A vertex cover is minimum if no other vertex cover has fewer vertices. Number of vertices in the minimum vertex cover set is lowest among all the vertex cover sets**

<br>

For example in the graph, **V_c = \{2, 3, 5\}** is a minimum vertex cover.

# Independent Set:
<br>

**An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no edge in the graph connects any pair of vertices in the independent set.**

<img src="images/vertex_cover1.png">

For example in the graph, vertex set **I = {1, 4}** or **I = {1, 3}** is an independent set. Because no edge in the graph connects any pair of vertices in the independent set **I**. 

<br>

<img src="images/independent_set1.png"> <img src="images/independent_set2.png">


But **Set {1, 4, 5} or {1, 2, 3}** is not an independent set. As we can see, an edge connect the pair of vertices (4, 5) which are in **{1, 4, 5}** and two edges connets the pairs of vertices (1, 2) and (2, 3) which are in **{1, 2, 3**.

<br>
<br>
<br>

**Finding any independent set is very easy, as any single vertex set can serve as an independent set. example I = {1} or I = {2} ..**
<br>
**But the real challenge lies in finding the maximum independent set.**

<br>
<br>

## Maximum Independent Set:
<br>

**An independent set is maximum if no other independent set contains more vertices.**
<br>
For example in the above graph **I = {1, 4}** is a maximum independent set. or **I = {1, 3}**. 

<br>
<br>

**Example for an bipartite graph:**
<br>

<img src ="images/Independent_bipartite1.png">

The **left** vertices set or **right** vertices set can be considered an **independent set**. But maximum independent set could be different. 
<br>

<img src ="images/Independent_bipartite2.png">

These independent set contains **3** vertices, But below the Maximum Independent set contains **4** vertices......

# The minimum vertex cover is the exact opposite of the maximum independent set:
<br>

**In a graph, the vertices in the maximum independent set are precisely those not included in the minimum vertex cover, and vice versa.**

<br>

For example minimum vertex cover **V_c = {2, 3, 5}** and maximum independent set **I = {1, 4}**. <br>
They are excatly opposite/complement of each other, ie. **I = {V - V_c} or V_c = {V - I}**.


<img src="images/vertex_cover3_235.jpg">  <img src="images/independent_set1.png">



<br>
<br>

**For a graph, if we find the minimum vertex cover, we can also determine the maximum independent set by simply taking the complement of the minimum vertex cover.**


<br>
<br>

**However, finding the minimum vertex cover or the maximum independent set for any graph is an NP-hard problem.**

<br>

**However, things become interesting when we consider a bipartite graph.**
